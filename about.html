                What is <strong>SGPA</strong><br><br>
               SGPA stands for Semester Grade Point Average. It is a measure of a student's academic performance
                     in a particular semester or term in an educational institution, particularly in the context of 
                     a grading system that uses grade points.

                <summary>Understanding the fundamentals</summary>
                <p>A student’s performance in a single academic semester is assessed using a metric called the semester
                     grade point average, or SGPA. It is determined by taking into account both the corresponding grades
                      earned in those courses as well as the credit hours or course units of each specific course completed 
                      during the semester. Compared to the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), which averages a student’s 
                      performance over several semesters, the Student Grade Point Average (SGPA) provides a more narrow perspective.</p>

                    <p>A simplified explanation of how SGPA is calculated in the JNTUH <br><br>

                        1.Grade Points: JNTUH typically uses a grading system where each letter grade corresponds to a specific grade point. For example:
                        
                        O (Outstanding): 10 points
                        A+ (Excellent): 9 points
                        A (Very Good): 8 points
                        B+ (Good): 7 points
                        B (Average): 6 points
                        C (Pass): 5 points
                        F (Fail): 0 points</p>
                    <p>
                        2.Credits : Each course or subject is assigned a certain number of credits, which represents the weightage of that course. The credits 
                        reflect the amount of academic work associated with the course.
                    </p>
                        3.Formula : SGPA= Sum of(credits\timesGrade Points)for all courses/Total Credits
